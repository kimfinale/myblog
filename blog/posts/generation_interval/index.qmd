### Growth rate, generation interval, and reproduction number

[Wallinga and Lipsitch](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2006.3754?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed) wrote a highly cited paper about the reproduction number. It discusses how to derive reproduction number, $R$, given the growth rate, $r$, and the generation interval, $T_c$.

$$
\begin{align}
R &= 1 + r/b\\
R &= (1 + r/b_1)(1 + r/b_2)\\
R &= \frac{(1 + r/b_1)^x}{\sum_{i=1}^y(1 + r/b_2)^{-i}}\\
\end{align}
$$

I can seem to use the third equation to reproduce the answer to the example the authors provided. On page 603, the authors gave the example of Influenza A where the generation interval has a mean of 2.85 days with the standard deviation of 0.93 days. The epidemic growth rate $r = 0.2$. "The $R=1.57$ for the SIR epidemic model, a value of $R=1.65$ for the SEIR epidemic model and a value of $R=1.66$ the more complicated epidemic model with one latent stage and two infectious stages (equation (3.3), with $x=1, y=2$)"

I tried to reproduce the results.

```{r}
Tc = 2.85
sigma = 0.93
r = 0.2
# for the SIR model
b = 1/Tc
(R = 1 + r/b)
# for the SEIR model, assume that b1 and b2 are the same
b1 = b2 = 2/Tc
(R = (1 + r/b1)*(1 + r/b2))
```

For the model with $x=1, y=2$, the $R$ is not the same as provided. $R$ can vary depending on how we set $b_1$ and $b_2$, but it is smaller than one.

```{r}
# for the SEIR model with x=1, y=2 (i.e., two consecutive . assume that b1 and b2 are the same
x = 1
y = 2
b1 = 2/Tc
b2 = 4/Tc

numer = function(x) (1 + r/b1)^x
denom = function(y) sum(sapply(1:y, function(i) (1+r/b2)^(-i)))

(R = numer(x=x)/denom(y=y))
```

The study also refers to [Wearing et al. (2005)](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020174) study and the result is below. Again, it is not $R=1.66$

```{r}
# as presented in Wearing et al.(2005)

m = 1
n = 2
b1 = 2/Tc
b2 = 4/Tc

numer = r*(r/(b1*m)+1)^m
denom = b2*(1-(r/(b2*n)+1)^(-n))
(R = numer / denom)
```

I implemented moment generating function to see if I can reproduce the results this way. One important aspect is that how we should set the rate to get the generation interval we want.

```{r}
mgf = function(b, r) b / (b + r)

1/mgf(b=1/Tc, r=r)

mgf_recursion = function(c, b, r){
  l = length(b)
  if (l == 1) {
    c * mgf(b, r)
  } 
  else {
    c[l] * mgf(b[l], r) * mgf_recursion(c=rep(1,length(b[1:(l-1)])), b=b[1:(l-1)], r=r)
  }
}

c = c(0,1/2,1/2)
b = c(3,3,3)/Tc

R0_recursion = function(c,b,r){
  out <- rep(NA, length(b))
  for (i in seq_along(b)) {
    out[i] = mgf_recursion(c[1:i], b[1:i], r)
  }
  1/sum(out)
}

R0_recursion(c=c(1), b=c(1)/Tc, r=0.2)
R0_recursion(c=c(0,1), b=c(2,2)/Tc, r=0.2)
# for y=2 (i.e., Gamma distribution with shape=2)
# use the relationship 
# average time to infection = beta*(1+alpha)/2 where beta and alpha represent scale and shape
# beta*(1+alpha)/2 = Tc/2
# rate = b = (1+alpha)/Tc
R0_recursion(c=c(0,1/2,1/2), b=c(2,3,3)/Tc, r=0.2)
```
