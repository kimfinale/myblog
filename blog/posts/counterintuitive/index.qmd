### $R_0$ and the prevalence of infection

[An article by Heesterbeek *et al*.](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa4339) provides a few examples on the counterintuitive behavior of a dynamical system of disease transmission. The first example was about the relationship between the intensity of transmission and the prevalence of infection, citing [the work by Anderson *et al*.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3892436/). One message from the study by Anderson *et al*. is that the effect of intervention should not be measured by the prevalence of infection. A similar message can be drawn from a simple relationship between $R_0$ and the prevalence of infection. As shown in the figure below, reducing $R_0$ from 15 to 10 may require a lot of efforts and its effect on prevalence of infection may be small.

```{r}
R0 <- seq(1, 20, by=0.1)
# R0*s = 1 is assumed, i.e., endemic steady state
prev <- 1 - 1/R0

df <- data.frame(R0=R0, Prev=prev)

library(ggplot2)
extrafont::loadfonts("win", quiet=TRUE)
theme_set(hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc(base_size=14, subtitle_size=16, axis_title_size=12))

ggplot(df,aes(x=R0))+
  geom_line(aes(y=prev))+ 
  ggtitle(expression("Prevalence of infection vs." ~italic(R)[0]))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1))+
  labs(x=expression(italic(R)[0]), y="Prevalence")
