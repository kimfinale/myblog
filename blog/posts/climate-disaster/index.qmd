[How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need](https://www.amazon.com/How-Avoid-Climate-Disaster-Breakthroughs/dp/059321577X) by Bill Gates is a comprehensive and accessible guide on how to tackle the urgent issue of climate change. Gates begins by laying out the scope of the problem, explaining that the world needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to zero to avoid a catastrophe. I've compiled important numbers from the book to understand the climate change issues.

-   51 Billion Tonnes: This is the amount of greenhouse gases, measured in CO2 equivalent ($\mathrm{CO_{2}e}$), that humanity adds to the atmosphere every year.

-   Zero: According to Bill Gates, we need to bring this number down to zero to avoid a climate disaster. And he thinks it is possible through our technological advances. Watch his TED talk, [Innovating to zero!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaF-fq2Zn7I&t=999s). He is a great speaker!
