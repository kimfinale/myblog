	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impact evaluation of vaccination programs is necessary for making decisions to introduce oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) in cholera-endemic countries. METHODS: We analyzed data to forecast the future global burden of cholera. We developed a mathematical model of cholera transmission in three countries as examples: Nigeria, Uganda, and Indonesia. After fitting the model, we evaluated the impact of OCVs delivered in four vaccination strategies varying by target age group and frequency of vaccination over the period of 2015-2030. RESULTS: Data suggest that the global annual incidence of cholera will increase from 3046238 in 2015 to 3787385 in 2030 with the highest burden in Asia and Africa where overall population size is large and the proportion of population with access to improved sanitation facilities is low. We estimate that OCV will reduce the cumulative incidence of cholera by half in Indonesia and {\textgreater}80\% in Nigeria and Uganda when delivered to 1+ year olds every three years at a coverage rate of 50\%, although cholera may persist through higher coverage rates (i.e., {\textgreater}90\%). The proportion of person-to-person transmission compared to water-to-person transmission is positively correlated with higher vaccination impact in all three countries. CONCLUSIONS: Periodic OCV vaccination every three or five years can significantly reduce the global burden of cholera although cholera may persist even with high OCV coverage. Vaccination impact will likely vary depending on local epidemiological conditions including age distribution of cases and relative contribution of different transmission routes.},

	abstract = {Rapid transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was observed in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect in South Korea. The index case was confirmed on February 18, 2020 in Daegu City, and within two weeks, 3081 connected cases were identified. Doubling times during these initial stages (i.e., February 18 â€“ March 2) of the outbreak were less than 2 days. A stochastic model fitted to the time series of confirmed cases suggests that the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was 8.5 [95\% credible interval (CrI): 6.3, 10.9] among the church members, whereas (R0 = 1.9 [95\% CrI: 0.4, 4.4]) in the rest of the population of Daegu City. The model also suggests that there were already 4 [95\% CrI: 2, 11] undetected cases of COVID-19 on February 7 when the index case reportedly presented symptoms. The Shincheonji Church cluster is likely to be emblematic of other outbreak-prone populations where R0 of COVID-19 is higher. Understanding and subsequently limiting the risk of transmission in such high-risk places is key to effective control.},

We sought to understand how dynamic sexual partnerships would influence transmissions during different progression stages of HIV infection: primary HIV infection (PHI) and chronic stage. Using a system of ordinary differential equations with a pair approximation technique, we constructed a model of HIV transmission in a homogeneous population in which sexual partnerships form and dissolve. We derived analytical expressions for useful epidemiological quantities such as basic reproduction number and also did simulation runs of the model. Partnership dynamics strongly influence transmissions during progressive stages of HIV infection. The fraction of transmissions during PHI has a U-shaped relationship with respect to the rate of partnership change, where the minimum and maximum occur given partnerships of about 100 days and fixed partnerships, respectively.

	abstract = {Background
Most model analyses examining the role of primary HIV infection in the HIV epidemic ignore the fact that HIV is often transmitted through long-term, concurrent sexual partnerships. We sought to understand how duration and concurrency of sexual partnerships affect the role of transmissions during primary HIV infection.

Methods
We constructed a stochastic individual-based model of HIV transmission in a homogeneous population where partnerships form and dissolve. Using observed contagiousness by stage of HIV infection, the fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection at equilibrium was examined across varying partnership durations and concurrencies.

Results
The fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection has a U-shaped relationship with partnership duration. The fraction drops with increasing partnership duration for partnerships with shorter average duration but rises for partnerships with longer average duration. Partnership concurrency modifies this relationship. The fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection increases with increasing partnership concurrency for partnerships with shorter average duration, but decreases for partnerships with longer average duration.

Conclusions
Partnership patterns strongly influence the transmission of HIV and do so differentially by stage of infection. Dynamic partnerships need to be taken into account to make a robust inference on the role of different stages of HIV infection.},

We sought to examine whether inferences from previous models are robust to the relaxation of those unrealistic assumptions. We developed a model of HIV transmissions through sexual partnerships assuming that (1) sexual partnerships have variable duration, (2) sexual partnerships are concurrent, and (3) the male-to-female transmission rate is higher than the female-to-male transmission rate, with a focus on the third assumption. Assuming a higher rate for male-to-female than female-to-male transmissions decreases the overall transmission of HIV but increases the equilibrium fraction of transmissions during primary HIV infection (PHI) in long-term partnerships, compared to the case where transmission rates are assumed to be symmetric between males an females. Previous modeling studies that assume symmetric transmission rates between males and females may have overestimated the overall spread of HIV, but underestimated the relative contribution of PHI. To make robust inferences on the role of different stages of HIV infection in the sexual spread of HIV, models should take into account that transmission rates may be asymmetric by sex.},

	abstract = {One drawback of oral polio vaccine (OPV) is the potential reversion to more transmissible, virulent circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs), which may cause outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis. Previous modeling studies of the transmission of cVDPVs assume an unrealistic homogeneous mixing of the population and/or ignore that OPV viruses and cVDPVs compete for susceptibles, which we show is a key to understanding the dynamics of the transmission of cVDPVs. We examined the transmission of OPV viruses and cVDPVs on heterogeneous, dynamic contact networks using differential equation-based and individual-based models. Despite the lower transmissibility, OPV viruses may outcompete more transmissible cVDPVs in the short run by spreading extensively before cVDPVs emerge. If viruses become endemic, however, cVDPVs eventually dominate and force OPV viruses to extinction. This study improves our understanding of the emergence of cVDPVs and helps develop more detailed models to plan a policy to control paralytic polio associated with the continued use of OPV in many countries.},

	abstract = {Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) play a pivotal role in controlling typhoid fever, as it is primarily transmitted through oral-fecal pathways. Given our constrained resources, staying current with the most recent research is crucial. This ensures we remain informed about practical insights regarding effective typhoid fever control strategies across various WASH components. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies to estimate the associations of water, sanitation, and hygiene exposures with typhoid fever. We updated the previous review conducted by Brockett et al. We included new findings published between June 2018 and October 2022 in Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed. We used the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for risk of bias (ROB) assessment. We classified WASH exposures according to the classification provided by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (JMP) update in 2015. We conducted the meta-analyses by only including studies that did not have a critical ROB in both Bayesian and frequentist random-effects models. We identified 8 new studies and analyzed 27 studies in total. Our analyses showed that while the general insights on the protective (or harmful) impact of improved (or unimproved) WASH remain the same, the pooled estimates of OR differed. Pooled estimates of limited hygiene (OR = 2.26, 95\% CrI: 1.38 to 3.64), untreated water (OR = 1.96, 95\% CrI: 1.28 to 3.27) and surface water (OR = 2.14, 95\% CrI: 1.03 to 4.06) showed 3\% increase, 18\% decrease, and 16\% increase, respectively, from the existing estimates. On the other hand, improved WASH reduced the odds of typhoid fever with pooled estimates for improved water source (OR = 0.54, 95\% CrI: 0.31 to 1.08), basic hygiene (OR = 0.6, 95\% CrI: 0.38 to 0.97) and treated water (OR = 0.54, 95\% CrI: 0.36 to 0.8) showing 26\% decrease, 15\% increase, and 8\% decrease, respectively, from the existing estimates. The updated pooled estimates of ORs for the association of WASH with typhoid fever showed clear changes from the existing estimates. Our study affirms that relatively low-cost WASH strategies such as basic hygiene or water treatment can be an effective tool to provide protection against typhoid fever in addition to other resource-intensive ways to improve WASH.

Enhancing the effectiveness of these strategies necessitates a deeper understanding of the variation of the typhoid fever across the target region. Although the magnitude and variation of typhoid fever at the country level have been studied globally, sub-national variation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we collected data from 265 published reports on typhoid fever occurrences in sub-Saharan Africa between January 2000 and December 2020. The dataset includes information on the year and geographical location of observation, diagnostic tests used, and the type of studies in which typhoid fever was reported.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With more than 1.2 million illnesses and 29,000 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2017, typhoid fever continues to be a major public health problem. Effective control of the disease would benefit from an understanding of the subnational geospatial distribution of the disease incidence.
METHOD: We collated records of the incidence rate of typhoid fever confirmed by culture of blood in Africa from 2000 to 2022. We estimated the typhoid incidence rate for sub-Saharan Africa on 20 km Ã— 20 km grids by exploring the association with geospatial covariates representing access to improved water and sanitation, health conditions of the population, and environmental conditions.
RESULTS: We identified six published articles and one pre-print representing incidence rate estimates in 22 sites in 2000-2022. Estimated incidence rates showed geospatial variation at sub-national, national, and regional levels. The incidence rate was high in Western and Eastern African subregions followed by Southern and Middle African subregions. By age, the incidence rate was highest among 5-14 yo followed by 2-4 yo, {\textgreater} 14 yo, and 0-1 yo. When aggregated across all age classes and grids that comprise each country, predicted incidence rates ranged from 43.7 (95\% confidence interval: 0.6 to 591.2) in Zimbabwe to 2,957.8 (95\% CI: 20.8 to 4,245.2) in South Sudan per 100,000 person-years. Sub-national heterogeneity was evident with the coefficient of variation at the 20 km Ã— 20 km grid-level ranging from 0.7 to 3.3 and was generally lower in high-incidence countries and widely varying in low-incidence countries.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides estimates of 20 km Ã— 20 km incidence rate of typhoid fever across sub-Saharan Africa based on data collected from 2000 through 2020. Increased understanding of the subnational geospatial variation of typhoid fever in Africa may inform more effective intervention programs by better targeting resources to heterogeneously disturbed disease risk.},

While our knowledge of a larger-scale variation is growing, understanding of the subnational variation in iNTS disease occurrence is lacking, yet crucial for targeted intervention.
METHOD: We performed a systematic review of reported occurrences of iNTS disease in sub-Saharan Africa, consulting literature from PubMed, Embase and Web of Science published since 2000. Eligibility for inclusion was not limited by study type but required that studies reported original data on human iNTS diseases based on the culture of a normally sterile site, specifying subnational locations and the year, and were available as full-text articles. We excluded studies that diagnosed iNTS disease based on clinical indications, cultures from non-sterile sites or serological testing. We estimated the probability of occurrence of iNTS disease for sub-Saharan Africa on 20 km Ã— 20â€‰km grids by exploring the association with geospatial covariates such as malaria, HIV, childhood growth failure, access to improved water, and sanitation using a boosted regression tree.
RESULTS: We identified 130 unique references reporting human iNTS disease in 21 countries published from 2000 through 2020. The estimated probability of iNTS occurrence grids showed significant spatial heterogeneity at all levels (20â€‰km Ã— 20â€‰km grids, subnational, country and subregional levels) and temporal heterogeneity by year. For 2020, the probability of occurrence was higher in Middle Africa (0.34, 95\%â€‰CI: 0.25 to 0.46), followed by Western Africa (0.33, 95\%â€‰CI: 0.23 to 0.44), Eastern Africa (0.24, 95\%â€‰CI: 0.17 to 0.33) and Southern Africa (0.08, 95\%â€‰CI: 0.03 to 0.11). Temporal heterogeneity indicated that the probability of occurrence increased between 2000 and 2020 in countries such as the Republic of the Congo (0.05 to 0.59) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.10 to 0.48) whereas it decreased in countries such as Uganda (0.65 to 0.23) or Zimbabwe (0.61 to 0.37).
CONCLUSION: The iNTS disease occurrence varied greatly across sub-Saharan Africa, with certain regions being disproportionately affected. Exploring regions at high risk for iNTS disease, despite the limitations in our data, may inform focused resource allocation. This targeted approach may enhance efforts to combat iNTS disease in more affected areas.},
